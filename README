lex/yacc grammar from http://www.quut.com/c/ANSI-C-grammar-l.html

stack functions exist

globals-
first, last, prev: for generating text structure line by line
currlex - current token location

some things about the grammar:
in the grammar, an expression means not only anything that evaluates to a value but also function calls e.g. printf() etc.
function definitions can be identified from function definition- declarator- direct declarator- direct declarator () in that order
and others similarly.

do not use 0 in enum, which is default for first element but is error for lex

for tesious replacements use regex with find and replace.
